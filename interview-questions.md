# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: In my experience of working in JavaScript a conditional statement is a kind of decision tree. JavaScript provides a couple keywords to set up conditionals and those key words are: if, and else. I have used conditionals to help create algorithms in past as they are excellent for making decisions about data. 

  Researched answer: A conditional statement in JavaScript is created by using the built-in keyword function of "if." "If" takes a statement that must evaluate to true inside of parens. The goal of using a conditional is to make to decisions about the data provided and execute code accordingly. I have used conditionals extensively in my functions in order to create complex algorithms. 



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: 
  Through my research I learned that the difference between Git and Github is indeed the fact that Git is local and Github is remote. To further go on detail, Git is a graphical user interface keeping track of your past actions retaining the source code during the software development process through your own local personal computer. Github in the other hand is a way you store your Git files via online, a service focused on centralizing source code with places in which codes are stored to a directory and essentialy a hosting service that can be available or accesed to the public allowing you to share your Git and other Developers are able to pair program or work/alter on your Git codes remotely. - Arnold L



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  Logical operators, equality operators, and relational operators will return a boolean value. Logical operators include the and, or, and not which are denoted by &&, ||, and ! respectively. The logical && states that both sides of the statement must be true. The logical || states that at least one side of the statement must be true. The logical ! states that whatever the statement is, the ! will negate that and make it the opposite. Equality operators include the == and === which denote to 'loosely equal to' and 'strictly equal to', respectively. Lastly, relational operators include the >, <, >=, and <= which essentially tries to find a relationship between two values. - Athen P





3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  The index is the location in an array, while the value is what is stored there. Index has the data type of number, while value can have any data type including composite data types of array and object. In class going over examples I realized that index will start at zero and be a position and value will be whatever I want at that position. - Keelan


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer:
  The syllabus better defines iteration as "the process of performing a particular action a certain number of times or until a condition is met." Further research shows me that For Loops and While Loops are a very common form of this, which makes sense. I initially thought if/else statements could be considered iteration on their own, but it seems like looping is required. If/else statements as I understand could have multiple steps, but the information is just being run through them once. - Kendra



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: 
  Proper pair programming procedure involves two programmers working together at one workstation. One programmer has the role of the driver who writes code while the other, the navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles often. The techniques of switching roles can include: Pomodoro Method, swapping on the hour, anything that the pair agrees to. I had an experience where the navigator wasn't watching what was going on and we got lost in the set up process of coding. The best times of pair programming allow us to catch each others mistakes and brainstorm ideas together.  - Nico P



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that accepts functions as a parameter or returns a function back to you. - Omar

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript Testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JS code base. Created by Facebook and used by Twitter Spotify and AirBnb

3. Objects: Objects are a composite Data type that contain collections of key value pairs. They are the cross section of data and behavior. 

4. Method: JS methods are actions that can be preformed on objects. 

5. Classes: Classes are templates for creating objects that encapsulate data and functions (methods) and also manipulate data. They called be called special functions that has two components class declaratives and class expressions.
